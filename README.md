# 🌿 Tendril

**A prepaid compute marketplace for individual contributors — metered in native ALGO on Algorand.**

Tendril is a lean, agent-first take on Akash / io.net, but for *individuals* instead of data
centers. Anyone can rent out their PC's CPU/RAM/GPU. A human (or an autonomous AI agent) **tops up a
prepaid ALGO balance once**, then rents a node and gets a sandboxed **SSH session** billed **by the
hour, prorated** — usage is tracked as it runs and **charged once when the lease ends** (or when the
balance is exhausted, which stops the session). The contributor is **paid on-chain** to their own
address when the lease ends, minus a small platform fee. No per-action signing, no x402.

## The trust model (why this is safe to contribute to)

A contributor gives *compute*, never filesystem or account access. The safety boundary isn't a
permissions system — it's an **ephemeral Docker container**:

- no host filesystem mounts (`-v` is never used),
- no inbound host ports — the sandbox dials *out* over a [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore)
  tunnel for SSH (in local mode it publishes SSH only to `127.0.0.1`),
- nearly all Linux capabilities dropped (`--cap-drop ALL` + only the handful sshd needs to let a
  root password login in, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`),
- hard CPU / memory / PID caps (cgroups),
- **destroyed the moment the paid lease ends.**

This is the same containerization trade-off the entire DePIN compute sector already runs on —
Tendril just makes it prepaid and individual-scale.

```

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | **The backend.** Express + **Neon (Postgres)** + socket.io. In-memory node registry, free `/explorer`, wallet sign-in + `/wallet/topup` (confirms ALGO deposits on-chain), `/rent/:id` (spends the prepaid balance), lease tokens for `/run` & `/release`, a **watchdog** that ends a lease when its balance runs out, and **on-chain payout** to the contributor when the lease ends. Only money state hits the DB. |
| `contributor/` | **The contributor script.** The daemon a contributor runs. Proves node ownership by signing a nonce, heartbeats, and on a lease spins up a hardened Docker **SSH** sandbox that exposes itself over a **bore** tunnel — torn down when the lease ends. |
| `web/` | **The website.** Vite + React + `@txnlab/use-wallet` (Pera/Defly). **Explore** (browse + rent + copyable **SSH** connect command + balance countdown), a **wallet panel** (balance + top-up + history), and **Contribute**. |
| `example-buyer/` | A headless autonomous "training agent": signs in → tops up if low → discovers → rents → runs a script → releases, with zero clicks. |
| `shared/` | Shared types, the WebSocket contract, and pricing helpers — imported by all of the above as `@tendril/shared`. |

How money flows: a user **signs in** with their wallet (a signed nonce proves address control), then
**tops up** by signing a native ALGO `pay` txn to the platform's custodial address — the registry
**confirms it on-chain via Algod** and credits an off-chain balance in Neon. Renting checks that
balance (no signing). The registry tracks the active session in memory; when the lease ends (release,
balance exhausted, or the node going away) it **bills once** — `prorated(elapsed) × hourly rate`,
debited in a single `charges` row — and **pays the contributor on-chain** (minus `PLATFORM_FEE_PCT`),
recording a `payouts` row. Nodes are *priced* in USD per hour (`PRICE_PER_HOUR_USD`), converted to a
microALGO/hour rate at a configurable `ALGO_USD_PRICE`. Deposits (`topups`), charges, and payouts are
all stored as history.

## The two agentic endpoints (and why they're agentic)

- `GET /explorer` — **free**, so an agent can survey live nodes (specs + price) and choose itself.
- `POST /rent/:nodeId` — starts an hourly-metered session against the agent's **prepaid balance** (no
  per-rent signing). Usage is **billed once at release**, prorated, and the session **auto-stops when
  the balance runs out**, so an agent burns money *only* for the compute it actually used. Top up
  ahead of time with `POST /wallet/topup`.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+ and npm
- A **Neon** Postgres database (free at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)) — its connection string is `DATABASE_URL`
- A **platform Algorand account** that receives top-ups *and* pays contributors: its address is
  `PLATFORM_PAYTO` and its 64-byte key is `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` (both from one `npm run keygen`)
- **Docker** (daemon running) — for the contributor agent's SSH sandboxes
- An **SSH client** to connect to a rented box (built into macOS/Linux/Windows). Public exposure uses
  an in-container **bore** tunnel — nothing to install on the contributor; or `TUNNEL_MODE=local`
  when consumer + agent share a machine
- **Algorand testnet** accounts funded with **ALGO** ([ALGO faucet](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/)) —
  no USDC, no ASA opt-in

> **Full setup, account prep, and production deployment (registry / web / agent) live in
> [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md).** The quick start below is for local dev.

## Quick start

Install once at the root (it's one npm-workspaces monorepo), then run each piece in its own
terminal. Every command has a root shortcut **and** works from inside its own folder — use whichever
you prefer.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env            # set DATABASE_URL (Neon), PLATFORM_PAYTO + PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY — REQUIRED
```

```bash
# 1. Backend / registry                          # http://localhost:4000
#    needs DATABASE_URL (Neon) + PLATFORM_PAYTO + PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY set in .env
npm run backend                 # …or:  cd backend     && npm run dev

# 2. Contributor agent — generate + fund a key first
npm run keygen                  # prints Address + AVM_PRIVATE_KEY  (cd contributor && npm run keygen)
AVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<key> PRICE_PER_HOUR_USD=1.0 npm run contributor   # …or:  cd contributor && npm run dev
#   tip: the SSH sandbox image builds locally on the first rent (cached after)
#   tip: same machine as the consumer? add TUNNEL_MODE=local

# 3a. Web UI                                      # http://localhost:5173
cp web/.env.example web/.env    # set VITE_REGISTRY_URL (defaults to localhost:4000)
npm run web                     # connect Pera → Sign in → Top up → Rent → copy the ssh command

# 3b. …or the autonomous agent (its own funded key — signs in, tops up, rents)
AVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<buyer-key> npm run client       # …or:  cd example-buyer && npm run start
```

Each top-level folder is a self-contained piece you can `cd` into: **`backend/`**, **`contributor/`**,
**`web/`**, **`example-buyer/`**, with **`shared/`** holding the types they all import.

## Run with Docker

Each piece is its own Compose service, run independently. The backend usually lives on a server; a
contributor runs on each machine sharing compute and points at that backend via **`REGISTRY_URL`**
in `.env`. The **web app is not dockerized** (it's a static Vite SPA — see [Web app](#web-app-static-spa) below).

```bash
cp .env.example .env                     # then set REGISTRY_URL to your backend

docker compose up --build backend        # run the backend / registry  → :4000
docker compose up --build contributor    # share THIS machine's compute
docker compose run  --rm   buyer         # one-shot autonomous buyer
```

The contributor **doesn't run a Docker of its own**: it mounts the host Docker socket and launches
each rented sandbox as a sibling container on the host daemon, so there's nothing extra to install
or start. Just set `REGISTRY_URL` in `.env` (e.g. `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:4000`) and bring it up.

- **backend** keeps only money state in **Neon** (`DATABASE_URL`) — no local volume; set
  `PLATFORM_PAYTO` + `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` too.
- **contributor** needs no inbound ports in the default `TUNNEL_MODE=bore` — each SSH sandbox dials
  *out* over bore. `network_mode: host` is only needed for `TUNNEL_MODE=local` (same-machine SSH),
  and on Docker Desktop (**Mac/Windows**) host networking doesn't share the loopback, so for local
  mode run the **contributor natively** (`npm run contributor`) instead.

### Web app (static SPA)

The web app isn't a container — it's a static build you host anywhere:

```bash
VITE_REGISTRY_URL=http://your-host:4000 npm run build -w web   # → web/dist
```

Drop `web/dist` on Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages / nginx (full steps in [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md)).

## Configuration

All Node services read the repo-root `.env` (and each app's own `.env`, which overrides it);
inline `FOO=bar npm run …` overrides both. The web app reads `web/.env` (`VITE_*` only, baked
in at build time). See [`.env.example`](./.env.example), [`web/.env.example`](./web/.env.example),
and the env tables in [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for every variable.

## Demo script (the money shot)

1. Start the **registry** and one **contributor** (a real machine sharing CPU/RAM).
2. Show the node appear in **Explore** at `http://localhost:5173`.
3. **Human path:** connect Pera (testnet) → **Sign in** → **Top up** (approve one ALGO deposit) →
   watch the balance appear → click **Rent** (no popup) → a copyable **`ssh root@… -p …`** command
   appears (password = your wallet address) with a balance-driven countdown. `ssh` in. **Release**
   (or letting the balance hit zero) bills the exact time used and destroys the sandbox.
4. **Autonomous path:** run `npm run client` and narrate the logs — the agent signs in, tops up if
   low, rents the cheapest node, runs a tiny training loop *on someone else's machine*, prints the
   falling loss, then releases and reports how much balance it drew down. No human clicked anything.
5. Show `docker ps` during the lease (a hardened, mount-less container) and that it's **gone** after
   release. On a testnet explorer, confirm the top-up *and* the **payout to the contributor**; in
   Neon, the single `charges` row (with the billed seconds) and the `payouts` row.

## What's verified vs. what needs your machine

Compiles + builds clean (full `npm run typecheck`, web production build). Requires your environment
to run end-to-end: a **Neon** database (`DATABASE_URL`), a **platform account** (`PLATFORM_PAYTO` +
`PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`), the Docker sandbox lifecycle (a running Docker daemon), outbound network for
the bore tunnel, an SSH client, and Algod reachable to confirm top-ups + send payouts (funded testnet
accounts).

## Notes & limitations

- **Custodial model:** top-ups pool at one platform address and balances are an off-chain ledger in
  Neon. Top-ups are confirmed on-chain and recorded by `txid` (idempotent — a deposit can't credit
  twice). Contributor earnings **are** settled on-chain on lease end (needs `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`);
  if it's unset, payouts are recorded as unpaid (`txid` null) instead.
- **Billing:** usage is **calculated continuously but charged once**, at lease end, prorated at the
  hourly rate (`elapsed/3600 × rate`) — no per-tick debits. A watchdog only checks every
  `METER_INTERVAL_MS` whether the balance is exhausted, so worst-case over-use is one tick.
- **Nodes + leases are in-memory:** a registry restart drops live sessions (the sockets die anyway).
  This is what keeps the DB quiet — heartbeats and the watchdog never write to Postgres.
- **SSH auth is a per-lease password (your wallet address)** over a throwaway root container; fine for
  ephemeral compute, but it's a password, not a key — use a real key flow for anything sensitive.
- **Auth:** spending the balance (rent, top-up, wallet read) requires a wallet **session token**,
  minted only after the user signs a login nonce — so nobody can spend someone else's balance.
- `web/` uses Vite (not Next.js) deliberately: the wallet stack is client-only, so an SPA
  avoids SSR/hydration friction.
