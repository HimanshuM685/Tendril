# Tendril — Setup & Deployment

This covers full local setup, Algorand testnet account prep, and production deployment of each
component. For the project overview and the demo script, see [README.md](./README.md).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Node 20+ & npm | runs everything | https://nodejs.org |
| **Neon** Postgres | stores wallets, top-ups, charges, payouts (`DATABASE_URL`) — *not* nodes/leases | https://neon.tech (free tier) |
| Docker (daemon running) | the contributor agent's SSH sandboxes | https://docs.docker.com |
| SSH client | renters connect to a rented box (public exposure uses an in-container **bore** tunnel — nothing to install on the contributor) | built into macOS/Linux/Windows |
| Algorand **testnet** accounts | platform (receives top-ups **+ pays contributors**), contributor, consumer (pays) | see below |

### Algorand testnet account prep

Payments are **native ALGO**, so there's no USDC and no ASA opt-in. Users **top up** a prepaid
balance by sending ALGO to the **platform custodial address** (`PLATFORM_PAYTO`); the registry
confirms each deposit on-chain and credits an off-chain ledger in Neon. On lease end it bills the
usage once and **pays the contributor on-chain** from the platform account.

- **Platform account (`PLATFORM_PAYTO` + `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`):** generate a key with
  `npm run keygen`; use its **Address** as `PLATFORM_PAYTO` and its **`AVM_PRIVATE_KEY`** as
  `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` (the registry signs payouts with it). Fund it with enough ALGO to cover
  payouts + txn fees — it's the pool that holds every user's prepaid balance.
- **Consumer accounts:** funded with ALGO to cover top-ups + the ~0.001 ALGO deposit txn fee.

1. **Generate a key** (prints `Address` + `AVM_PRIVATE_KEY`):
   ```bash
   npm run keygen
   ```
2. **Fund with testnet ALGO:** https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/ (paste the address).
3. Keep each `AVM_PRIVATE_KEY` secret. The base64 value is a 64-byte key (seed + public key).

## 2. Local setup

```bash
git clone <repo> tendril && cd tendril
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # edit values; root .env is picked up by all Node apps
```

`.env` is read by the backend, contributor, and example-buyer (each app's own `.env` overrides the
root one; inline `FOO=bar npm run ...` overrides both). The web app reads `web/.env` (Vite,
`VITE_*` only).

Run each piece in its own terminal:

```bash
npm run backend       # http://localhost:4000  (needs DATABASE_URL + PLATFORM_PAYTO + PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY)
npm run contributor   # contributor daemon (needs AVM_PRIVATE_KEY + Docker running)
npm run web           # http://localhost:5173
npm run client        # the autonomous consumer agent (needs its own funded AVM_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

Tips:
- The SSH sandbox image builds locally on the first rent (from `contributor/sandbox-ssh`) and is
  cached after — the first rent waits on that one-time build.
- Running the agent on the **same machine** as the consumer? Set `TUNNEL_MODE=local` to skip bore and
  SSH to `127.0.0.1:<port>` instead.
- Useful checks: `curl localhost:4000/health`, `curl localhost:4000/explorer`.

## 3. Production deployment

Three independently deployable pieces: **backend** (central registry service), **web** (static
site), **contributor** (runs on each contributor's own machine). The autonomous client runs anywhere.

### 3a. Backend / registry (central API)

Requirements: a long-running Node host with **WebSocket** support, a **Neon** Postgres database
(`DATABASE_URL`), outbound HTTPS to an **Algod** endpoint (to confirm top-ups **and send payouts**),
and (if the web app is HTTPS) **TLS**. No local disk/volume — only money state lives in Neon; nodes
and leases are in-memory.

**Option A — Docker (provided):**
```bash
# build from the repo root
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t tendril-backend .
docker run -d --name tendril-backend \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" \
  -e PLATFORM_PAYTO=<your-platform-algorand-address> \
  -e PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-64-byte-key-for-that-address> \
  -e PLATFORM_FEE_PCT=10 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e CORS_ORIGIN=https://tendril.your-domain.com \
  tendril-backend
```

**Option B — PaaS (Railway / Render / Fly.io):**
- Start command: `npm run start -w backend` (no build step — `tsx` runs the TS directly).
- Set env vars (below). No volume needed — point `DATABASE_URL` at Neon.
- Ensure WebSockets are enabled (Render/Railway: on by default; Fly: TCP/HTTP service is fine).

**Option C — bare VPS + systemd + nginx:**
- `npm ci --omit=dev` on the box, run `npm run start -w backend` under systemd (or pm2).
- Put nginx/Caddy in front for TLS, and **proxy WebSocket upgrades**:
  ```nginx
  location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
  ```

Registry env vars:

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY_PORT` | `4000` | |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | **required** — Neon Postgres connection string (keep `?sslmode=require`) |
| `PLATFORM_PAYTO` | — | **required** — custodial Algorand address that receives top-ups |
| `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` | — | **required for payouts** — base64 64-byte key for `PLATFORM_PAYTO`; signs on-chain contributor payouts. If unset, payouts are recorded as unpaid |
| `PLATFORM_FEE_PCT` | `10` | platform's % cut of each charge; the rest is paid to the contributor |
| `JWT_SECRET` | dev value | **set a strong secret in prod** (signs wallet-session + lease tokens) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | set to your web origin(s), comma-separated |
| `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | node considered offline after this gap |
| `ALGO_USD_PRICE` | `0.20` | USD per 1 ALGO — converts the USD price to the microALGO/**hour** rate |
| `METER_INTERVAL_MS` | `10000` | how often the **watchdog** checks active leases for balance exhaustion (no per-tick billing) |
| `ALGOD_TESTNET_URL` | `https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud` | Algod used to confirm top-ups + send payouts |

### 3b. Web app (static SPA)

It's a Vite build — pure static assets. Set `VITE_REGISTRY_URL` **at build time**.

```bash
VITE_REGISTRY_URL=https://api.your-tendril-domain.com npm run build -w web
# output: web/dist  → upload to any static host
```

**Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages:**
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build -w web`
- Output directory: `web/dist`
- Env var: `VITE_REGISTRY_URL = https://api.your-tendril-domain.com`
- SPA rewrite: serve `index.html` for all routes (Netlify `_redirects`: `/* /index.html 200`;
  Vercel/CF Pages handle SPAs automatically).

> **Mixed content:** if the site is served over HTTPS, the registry **must** also be HTTPS/WSS,
> or browsers will block the API + socket calls.

### 3c. Contributor agent (on each contributor's machine)

The agent is *not* centrally deployed — each contributor runs it on the machine whose compute they
share. It needs Docker locally; SSH is exposed by a **bore** tunnel that runs *inside* each sandbox
(it dials out), so there's nothing extra to install or open.

```bash
# on the contributor's machine
git clone <repo> tendril && cd tendril && npm install
AVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<their-key> \
REGISTRY_URL=https://api.your-tendril-domain.com \
NODE_LABEL="ryzen-3090-box" PRICE_PER_HOUR_USD=2.0 SANDBOX_GPUS=all \
  npm run contributor
```

Keep it alive with **pm2** (`pm2 start "npm run contributor" --name tendril-contributor`) or a systemd unit.
The renter gets an `ssh root@<bore-host> -p <port>` command (password = the renter's wallet address).
`PAYTO_ADDR` (defaults to the signing address) is where this node's **on-chain payouts** land. To run
your own bore server instead of the public `bore.pub`, point `BORE_SERVER` at it.

Agent env vars: `AVM_PRIVATE_KEY` (required), `REGISTRY_URL`, `NODE_LABEL`, `PRICE_PER_HOUR_USD`,
`PAYTO_ADDR` (defaults to the signing address — receives payouts), `SANDBOX_IMAGE` (defaults to the
locally-built `tendril-ssh-sandbox`), `SANDBOX_MEMORY`, `SANDBOX_CPUS`, `SANDBOX_GPUS` (`all` to pass
GPUs), `TUNNEL_MODE` (`bore`|`local`), `BORE_SERVER` (default `bore.pub`).

### 3d. Autonomous consumer agent

Runs anywhere (CI, a laptop, a server) with a funded key:

```bash
AVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<buyer-key> REGISTRY_URL=https://api.your-tendril-domain.com \
AGENT_MIN_RAM_MB=2048 AGENT_TOPUP_ALGO=0.5 npm run client
```

It signs in, tops up its prepaid balance if it's below `AGENT_TOPUP_ALGO`, rents the cheapest
matching node, runs its job, and releases — reporting how much balance it drew down.

## 4. Production checklist

- [ ] Strong `JWT_SECRET` on the registry.
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` points at Neon; `PLATFORM_PAYTO` + `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` set to an account you
      control and **funded** (it pays out every contributor); `PLATFORM_FEE_PCT` reviewed.
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` locked to your web origin.
- [ ] Registry + web both HTTPS (avoid mixed-content blocking); WebSocket upgrades proxied.
- [ ] Algod (`ALGOD_TESTNET_URL`) reachable from the registry host (top-ups + payouts) and clients.
- [ ] `ALGO_USD_PRICE` set to a sane rate (or wired to a price feed); `METER_INTERVAL_MS` reviewed.
- [ ] `VITE_REGISTRY_URL` + `VITE_ALGOD_URL` baked into the web build.
- [ ] Contributors pre-build `SANDBOX_IMAGE` (`docker build -t tendril-ssh-sandbox contributor/sandbox-ssh`);
      agents kept alive (pm2/systemd) with Docker running + outbound network for bore.
- [ ] Consumer accounts hold **ALGO** for top-ups (+ txn fees). No USDC / ASA opt-in needed.
- [ ] Safeguard `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` — it custodies user top-ups *and* signs every payout.

## 5. Known limitations

- **Custodial:** top-ups pool at `PLATFORM_PAYTO` and balances are an off-chain ledger in Neon.
  Contributor earnings **are** settled on-chain at lease end (via `PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`); there's no
  on-chain *renter* withdrawal path for unused balance yet.
- **Billing granularity:** usage is calculated continuously but **charged once**, at lease end,
  prorated at the hourly rate. The watchdog only checks balance exhaustion every `METER_INTERVAL_MS`,
  so worst-case over-use is one tick before teardown.
- **In-memory nodes/leases:** a registry restart drops live sessions (their sockets die too). This is
  deliberate — it keeps Postgres out of the heartbeat/watchdog hot path. For HA, persist + externalize.
- **SSH auth** is a per-lease password (the renter's wallet address) on a throwaway root container —
  fine for ephemeral compute, but use a key-based flow for anything sensitive.
- `ALGO_USD_PRICE` is a static rate; for production wire it to a price feed so charges track the market.
- A single registry instance owns the WebSocket hub *and* the in-memory state; for horizontal scale
  externalize both (e.g. a socket.io Redis adapter + shared store).
- The public `bore.pub` server is best-effort/rate-limited; run your own `BORE_SERVER` for anything
  beyond demos.
